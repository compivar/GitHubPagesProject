## CSE 110

This assignment is **Due Soon**.

There is an emphasis on *soon*.

I meant to say break, not ~~brake~~.

Make sure to **write your name** on the page.

As always, ***Do not cheat*** on the assignment.
<sub>If you do cheat there will be consequences.</sub>

Please do your own work.
<sup>Academic integrity</sup>
